**Smart Home Automation System**
The Smart Home Automation System is a cutting-edge solution designed to simplify and modernize home environments by enabling remote control and automation of household devices. This project is an advanced implementation aimed at making daily living more comfortable, energy-efficient, and user-friendly.

**Key Features:**
Remote Control: Control home devices such as lights, air conditioning, and doors via mobile or laptop.
Emergency Manual Control: Equipped with an LCD and keypad interface for manual control in case of emergencies or when the mobile/laptop isn't available.
Comprehensive Device Management: Includes control of:
5 On/Off lamps
1 Dimmable lamp
Door access control (servo motor)
Air conditioner (based on ambient temperature)
Temperature-Based Automation: The system automatically adjusts the air conditioning based on real-time ambient temperature, using a temperature sensor to maintain optimal comfort.

**Security:**
User Login: Only authenticated users can control the system, with an admin having the ability to override control.
Password Protected Access: Multiple users can log in with different credentials for the keypad system and the remote system.

**Application Use Cases:**
Ideal for transforming a traditional home into a smart home with minimal effort.
Perfect for scenarios where energy efficiency and remote accessibility are priorities.
Enhances security with door access controls and user-specific privileges.
This project showcases the potential of combining embedded systems and IoT technologies to bring the future of home automation into the present
